# raspberry pi dashboard

This dashboard is my personal playground.
It will switch between 4 live cams on youtube with a nice text overlay.

It can be used in landscape or portrait mode which is my favorite one.

## landscape vs. portrait

Landscape is the default so if you are fine with that, no change is required.
If you want portait mode just add a ?portrait=1 to the url
